## 🔌 API Client Setup

When developing and testing your Express server, an API client is essential for interacting with and verifying your endpoints. It allows you to send requests to your server and view responses, ensuring everything works as expected before moving on to more complex integrations or deployments.

### **Why You Need an API Client:**

An API client helps you:
*   🧪 Test individual endpoints.
*   🐞 Debug issues by inspecting request/response details.
*   ✅ Validate backend logic independently of the frontend.
<br>

### **Recommended Options:**

1.  **Thunder Client** (Preferred for VS Code Users):
    *   ⚡ Integrated directly into VS Code.
    *   🌟 Lightweight and easy to use.
    *   💻 Ideal for quick tests without leaving the code editor.
        
2.  **Postman**:
    *   🚀 A standalone application with advanced features like automated testing, mock servers, and collaboration tools.
        
3.  **Insomnia**:
    *   😌 Known for its simplicity and ease of use.
    *   📊 Supports both RESTful APIs and GraphQL queries.
        
4.  **cURL**:
    *   💻 A command-line tool available on most operating systems. Useful for sending requests directly from the terminal.

### **In Case You Don’t Get It Yet:**

Think of an API client like a chef's tasting spoon; it lets you sample each dish (API endpoint) individually before serving it at a dinner party (production). This ensures every component tastes just right!

By using tools like Thunder Client or any other mentioned options, you streamline testing and debugging processes right where you write your code!
