## 📖 Introduction

### 🌐 How a Website Works

A website consists of two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is what users interact with directly in their web browser - design, buttons, text, and images. The backend handles data processing, storage, and business logic.

#### Simplified Flow:
1. **User Request**: User interacts with the frontend.
2. **HTTP Request**: Frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend.
3 .**Backend Processing:** Backend processes request .
4 .**Database Interaction:** Backend retrieves stores data database .
5 .**HTTP Response:** Backend sends response back frontend .
6 .**Frontend Update:** Frontend updates UI based on response .

### 🛠️ What is Node.js?

- **What**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
- **Why**:
  - Single Programming Language for both frontend and backend (JavaScript).
  - Vibrant Ecosystem with npm (Node Package Manager).
