1. **User Request**: User interacts with the frontend.
2. **HTTP Request**: Frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend.
3. **Backend Processing**: Backend processes the request.

5 .**HTTP Response:** Backend sends response back to frontend .
6 .**Frontend Update:** Frontend updates UI based on response .
