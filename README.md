## 📖 Introduction

### 🌐 How a Website Works

A website consists of two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is what users interact with directly in their web browser - design, buttons, text, and images. The backend handles data processing, storage, and business logic.

In this guide, we will walk you through setting up a robust Node.js application using Express.js. From project setup to configuring an API client, setting up routers, implementing controllers, managing HTTP methods and middleware, configuring databases, adding authentication with JWTs and MongoDB integration to understanding schema relationships—each step is meticulously detailed to help you build a comprehensive backend for your web applications. By following these steps sequentially, you'll gain hands-on experience in creating a scalable and basic server-side architecture.

#### Simplified Flow:
1. **User Request**: User interacts with the frontend.
2. **HTTP Request**: Frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend.
3 .**Backend Processing:** Backend processes request .
4 .**Database Interaction:** Backend retrieves stores data database .
5 .**HTTP Response:** Backend sends response back frontend .
6 .**Frontend Update:** Frontend updates UI based on response .

### 🛠️ What is Node.js?

- **What**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
- **Why**:
  - Single Programming Language for both frontend and backend (JavaScript).
  - Vibrant Ecosystem with npm (Node Package Manager).

### 🚀 Benefits of Using Express.js with Node.js

Express.js is a framework for Node.js that simplifies web application development.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Simplified Routing**: Making it easier to manage different endpoints in your application - Manages customer orders efficiently.
- **Middleware Support**: Express.js has built-in support for middleware, allowing you to add additional functionality to your application, such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Express.js is lightweight and unopinionated, giving you the freedom to structure your application as you see fit.
- **Integration with Databases**: Express.js easily integrates with various databases, whether SQL or NoSQL, through different libraries and modules.
